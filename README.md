I'm a 16-year-old software developer and cybersecurity enthusiast with a focus on Windows & Linux environments. I build tools, systems, and scripts that solve real problems, streamline workflows, and push technical boundaries.

I develop software for private companies, groups, and personal projects, consistently working across:

- **C#**, **C++**, **JavaScript**, **Python**
- **Lua / Luau** for advanced Roblox tooling and systems
- Scripting and automation across Windows and Linux

My interests include:

- Reverse engineering and vulnerability research
- Game exploitation and advanced scripting (primarily Roblox)
- Creating secure, modular, and maintainable tools
- Building private frameworks for automation and control

I treat every project as an opportunity to refine my craft, learn deeper layers of the systems I work with, and build things that others told me "aren't possible."
